Q2. Expalin the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model:

    1.Justify-content:
        The Justify-content property in Flexbox is used to control the alignement of flex item along the main axis of the flex containers.
        It determines how the extra space or insufficiet space along the main axis distributed. There are several values for justify-content
        including flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-evenly space-around.

        

    2.align-item:
        The align-item property controls the alignement of flex item along the cross axis the flex containers. It specifies how items are positioned
        within their containers aling this axis. It accepts values such as flex-start, flex-end, center baseline, and stretch.

    3.gap:
        The gap property is used to define the space between flex item in both directions, both along the main axis and the cross axis. It'
        often applied to the flex contaier itslef. it simplifies spacing and creates consistent gaps between item without needing to apply margins
        to individual item.

    4.flex-directons:
        The flex directions property determines the directions in which flex item are placed within the felx containers. Ti defines the mainaxis 
        and consequently, the layout flow. It can have values such as row, row-reverse, cloumns, or columns-reverse.

    5.Flex-weap:
        The flex-wrap property controls whether flex item are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines(new rows and columns) within the flex containers
        when they don't fit along the main axis. It accepts values like nowrap, wrap, and wrap-reverse.
